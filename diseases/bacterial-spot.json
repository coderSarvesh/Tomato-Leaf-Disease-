    "name":"Bacterial Spot",

    "about":"This disease is caused by several species of the bacterium Xanthomonas (but primarily by Xanthomonas perforans), which infect green but not red tomatoes. Peppers are also infected. The disease is more prevalent during wet seasons. Damage to the plants includes leaf and fruit spots, which result in reduced yields, defoliation, and sunscalded fruit. The symptoms consist of numerous small, angular to irregular, water-soaked spots on the leaves and slightly raised to scabby spots on the fruits. The leaf spots may have a yellow halo. The centers dry out and frequently tear.",
  
    "remedy":"Only use certified disease-free seeds and plants. Avoid areas that were planted with peppers or tomatoes during the previous year. Avoid overhead watering by using drip or furrow irrigation. Remove and dispose of all diseased plant material. Prune plants to promote air circulation. Spraying with a copper fungicide will give fairly good control of the bacterial disease."
