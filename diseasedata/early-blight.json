    "about":"This disease is caused by the fungi Alternaria linariae (formally known as A. solani) and is first observed on the plants as small, brown lesions mostly on the older foliage. Spots enlarge and concentric rings in a bull’s-eye pattern may be seen in the center of the diseased area. The tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed. Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves and sometimes girdle the plant if they occur near the soil line (collar rot). On the fruits, lesions attain considerable size, usually involving nearly the entire fruit. Concentric rings are also present on the fruit. Infected fruit frequently drops.",
    
    "remedy":"Use resistant or tolerant tomato cultivars. Use pathogen-free seed and do not set diseased plants in the field. Use crop rotation, eradicate weeds and volunteer tomato plants, space plants to not touch, mulch plants, fertilize properly, don’t wet tomato foliage with irrigation water, and keep the plants growing vigorously. Trim off and dispose of infected lower branches and leaves.To reduce disease severity, test the garden soil annually and maintain a sufficient level of potassium. Lime the soil according to soil test results. Side dress tomato plants monthly with calcium nitrate for adequate growth.If the disease is severe enough to warrant chemical control, select one of the following fungicides: mancozeb (very good); chlorothalonil or copper fungicides (good). Follow the directions on the label. See Table 1 for examples of fungicide products for home garden use. See Table 2 for tomato cultivars with resistance or tolerance to early blight.",
