    "name":"Leaf Mold",

    "about":"The fungus Passalora fulva causes leaf mold. It is first observed on older leaves near the soil where air movement is poor and humidity is high. The initial symptoms are pale green or yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, which enlarge and turn a distinctive yellow. Under humid conditions, the spots on the lower leaf surfaces become covered with a gray, velvety growth of the spores produced by the fungus. When infection is severe, the spots coalesce, and the foliage is killed. Occasionally, the fungus attacks stems, blossoms and fruits. Green and mature fruit can have a black, leathery rot on the stem end.The fungus survives on crop residue and in the soil. Spores are spread by rain, wind, or tools. Seeds can be contaminated. The fungus is dependent on high relative humidity and high temperature for disease development..",
    
    "remedy":"Crop residue should be removed from the field. Staking and pruning to increase air circulation helps to control the disease. Space tomato plants further apart for better air circulation between plants. Avoid wetting leaves when watering. Rotate with vegetables other than tomatoes. Using a preventative fungicide program with chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper fungicide, can control the disease. See Table 1 for fungicide products for home garden use.",
