    "name":"Late Blight",

    "about":"Late blight is a potentially serious disease of potato and tomato and is caused by the water mold pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Late blight is especially damaging during cool, wet weather. This pathogen can affect all plant parts. Young leaf lesions are small and appear as dark, water-soaked spots. These leaf spots will quickly enlarge, and a white mold will appear at the margins of the affected area on the lower surface of leaves. Complete defoliation (browning and shriveling of leaves and stems) can occur within 14 days from the first symptoms. Infected tomato fruits develop shiny, dark, or olive-colored lesions, which may cover large areas. Fungal spores are spread between plants and gardens by rain and wind. A combination of daytime temperatures in the upper 70s Â°F with high humidity is ideal for infection.",
    
    "remedy":"Keep foliage dry. Locate your garden where it will receive morning sun. Allow extra room between the plants, and avoid overhead watering, especially late in the day.Purchase certified disease-free seeds and plants.Destroy volunteer tomato and potato plants, as well as nightshade family weeds, such as Carolina horsenettle or black nightshade, which may harbor the fungus.Do not compost rotten, store-bought potatoes.Pull out and destroy diseased plants.If the disease is severe enough to warrant chemical control, select one of the following fungicides: chlorothalonil (very good), copper fungicide, or mancozeb (good).",
